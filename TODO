- ELF loader
- module system (_pre, run(), _post)
- boot command line for option lookup
- ELF symbol look up (Multiboot2 Spec p.12)  (easy)
- make sure registers are correct (and add more) in panic dumps (use exception frame)
- setup PAT/MTRRs
- get framebuffer address from multiboot
- setup variable-sized pages
- finish namespace fixes (prepending nk_)
- add scheduler quanta 
- time thread switch
- time to do a task wakeup (signal task to task wakeup)


TOOD NEAR: 
- HPET timer
- RTC timer
- fix up clock_gettime
- replace malloc
- boot Nautilus on leviathan
- look at cache sizes on GPU box and t620
- legion optimizations
- load balance across cores (probably ok to leave this up to the runtime)


HARDWARE IDEAS FOR LEGION:

- RAM refresh turn off? Encoding?
- NUMA? 
- IPI (scheduling event)
  - cooperative multithreading with mwait
